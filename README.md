About the Project

Share-Anything is a simple and efficient web service designed to facilitate sharing files, texts, and other content seamlessly. The service is hosted on Render.com, chosen for its affordability, user-friendly interface, and free-tier hosting capabilities.

We have used Node.js as the primary back-end technology to store and retrieve values, allowing users to share data across multiple browsers on the same website.

Features

Why We Built This

While there are many platforms for communication and file-sharing, this project was created as a learning experience to understand:

1. Communication Protocols - How data is transferred efficiently between users.


2. Static Web Integration - How static web pages can be combined with Node.js modules for back-end functionality.
